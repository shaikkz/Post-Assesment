Replica SET
This kind is used usually when we want Pods to be created of the same containers.
By comparing teh desired current , ready 
Supports set selector 
Match selector label
Kubectl get rs
Situation : In the DB when deposition happens then at all times you want the DB to be up so we can select one set and keep a replica up always,
beacuse in production you would want require the pods to be 100%.
Draw bcak : In some scenarios due to load balancing same pods will not be allocated to each node. So in such cases we use daemon set.
kubectl apply -f kubia-replicaset.yaml 
kubectl get po -o wide
curl <ip>:8000

kind:service
